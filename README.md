Portfolio code samples from cancelled project "Firebrand"

Firebrand was essentially two games, a strategy map where players dispatched their agents for electoral shenanigans, then a turn-based tactics game whenever opposing agents clashed. 

Features:
Procedurally generated city maps with demographics, points of interest, and information levels.
Procedurally generated turn-based tactical maps in the city streets, with generated buildings and other decoration.
Interlocking layers of gameplay, so that events in the Tactics layer impacted the Strategy layer.

Firebrand received Concept Definition funding from Ontario Creates, and was a finalist at the 2021 Ubisoft Indie series. However, it was dropped due to its large scope and the team becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the gameâ€™s themes in relation to current events. Presented here are a selection of the code for the Strategy Layer with assets or licensed code removed.
